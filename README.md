# assignment


Here in this project I have used.
mysql: 5.7.6
django: 2.1.7
python: 3.5.2


after cloning the repo, we will have to create a database of name tasks in mysql
we also will have to create a user with name 'shivam' and password 'shivam'.

Then we will have to run 
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate


The we can check the result. I have not used Ajax earlier. I used to do url hyperlink creation using jinja template.
